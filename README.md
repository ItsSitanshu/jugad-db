# Jugad-DB 

**Jugad-DB** is a personal database system that provides basic functionality, this is meant to be used as a simple database
and nothing else. Not to compete with any other real, professional database systems, this is purely for personal learning
and personal development.

You may modify, steal and use my terrible database implementation to make money.
